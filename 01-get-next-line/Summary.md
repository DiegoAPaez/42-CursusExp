```c
char	*ft_release(char *s)
```

- Frees the memory allocated to the string s and sets the pointer to NULL.
- Returns NULL.

```c
char	*ft_freeline(char *string)
```

- Finds the newline character in string.
- If no newline is found, returns NULL.
- Extracts the substring after the newline and returns it.
- If the extracted substring is empty, it releases the memory and returns NULL.
- Modifies the original string to end at the newline character.

```c
char	*ft_buffer_handler(char *string, char *buffer)
```

- Joins the buffer to the string.
- If string is NULL, initializes it as an empty string.
- Frees the temporary string used for joining.
- Returns the concatenated string.

```c
char	*ft_readfile(int fd, char *string, char *buffer)
```

- Reads from the file descriptor fd into buffer until a newline is found or EOF is reached.
- If an error occurs during reading, releases the memory and returns NULL.
- Concatenates the buffer to the string.
- Stops reading if a newline is found in the buffer.
- Returns the updated string.

```c
char	*get_next_line(int fd)
```

- Manages reading lines from a file descriptor fd.
- Uses a static array string to store the remaining data for each file descriptor.
- Allocates a buffer for reading.
- Calls ft_readfile to read data from the file descriptor into the buffer and update string.
- Frees the buffer after reading.
- If no line is read, releases the memory for the file descriptor and returns NULL.
- Extracts the next line from string using ft_freeline.
- Returns the extracted line.
