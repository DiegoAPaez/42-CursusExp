# My 42 Barcelona Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my progress and experience at [42 Barcelona](https://www.42barcelona.com), where I’m learning by doing through an intensive, project-based curriculum. This repository will gradually grow as I complete each project in my cursus, covering a wide range of programming topics and skills.

## About This Repository 🛠️

This repository will serve as a comprehensive log of my journey, documenting each project along with insights gained and skills developed along the way. Each project follows 42's rigorous standards and is designed to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. As I finish and polish each project, I’ll add it here with clear instructions, documentation, and notes for anyone interested in exploring or using the code.

## What You'll Find Here 📂

While this repository is a work in progress, here’s a preview of the kinds of projects that will eventually be included:

- **Foundation Projects**: Mastering the fundamentals of C programming, memory management, and Git.
- **Algorithm Challenges**: Problem-solving and algorithm design with an emphasis on optimization and efficiency.
- **System-Level Programming**: Diving into Unix systems, network programming, and process management.
- **Web Development**: Exploring backend development, databases, and web APIs.
- **Creative and Collaborative Projects**: Working with peers on larger, real-world inspired applications.

## List of Projects 💻

Here is a list of projects included in this repository, along with their current status:

- **libft** - _Complete_ ✅: A custom C library that replicates functions from the C standard library.
- **get_next_line** - _Complete_ ✅: A program that reads lines from a file descriptor in a memory-efficient way.
- **ft_printf** - _In Progress_ 🔄: Building a formatted output conversion library similar to `printf`.
